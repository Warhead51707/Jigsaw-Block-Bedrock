# ‚ùì What is this?
This project aims to port the Jigsaw block from Java edition into Bedrock. The current system we have for Bedrock is very powerful on its own & reflects a large portion of the Java system. Please keep in mind that not all features from the Java system are available for Bedrock.

# ‚ùó Where can I get help/track the project?
