# ‚ùì What is this?
This project aims to port the Jigsaw block from Java edition into Bedrock. The current system we have for Bedrock is very powerful on its own & reflects a large portion of the Java system. Please keep in mind that not all features from the Java system are available for Bedrock.

If you are not familiar with the Jigsaw block, I highly suggest you take the time to read this [wiki page](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Jigsaw_Block).

# üß© What can I make with the library right now?
Jigsaw Block Bedrock offers many of the same features as Java Edition's Jigsaw block and we believe that JBB is close to being just as powerful. 

**We plan to fully support all the features from Java Edition within Bedrock's limited capabilities.**

Currently, the library is packed with, 

- 4 direction Jigsaw blocks (Up and Down not yet supported, coming soon)
- Automatic structure rotation and offset adjustment
- Automatic structure collision detection
- Simple Jigsaw UI
- Multiple test structures
- Node JS automatic install script

# ‚ùó Where can I get help/track the project?
If you're experiencing trouble or want to share what you're working on, we encourage you to join our [discord server]() or make an [issue here on Github](https://github.com/Warhead51707/Jigsaw-Block-Bedrock/issues).

**We would love as much support as we can get! The more people who step foward to make 100% open source, easy to use/download libraries, the further we can get in advancing our creation capabilities.**

# ‚ù§Ô∏è 100% Open Source
