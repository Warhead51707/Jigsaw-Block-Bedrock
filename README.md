# ‚ö†Ô∏è EARLY ACCESS (v 0.0.1) ‚ö†Ô∏è
**For those that are downloading:** if you are using Jigsaw Block Bedrock for your Add-On, please go to the releases section on this repository and download from there. If you download the raw contents of the repository, your Add-On will contain Typescript and it will not work in game (unless you have a compiler). **Instructions for the installation methods is found further below.**

**It is highly reccomended that you read our wiki page on [installation](https://github.com/Warhead51707/Jigsaw-Block-Bedrock/wiki/Installation) before installing.**

# ‚ùì What is this?
This project aims to port the Jigsaw block from Java edition into Bedrock. The current system we have for Bedrock is very powerful on its own and reflects a VERY large portion of the Java system. Please keep in mind that not all features from the Java system are available for Bedrock, this includes terrain matching, processor lists, and feature type. **I plan to add all of these features with future updates!** 

If you are not familiar with the Jigsaw block, I highly suggest you take the time to read this [wiki page](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Jigsaw_Block).

Currently, we are a Minecraft Preview exclusive. Once the Structure API features come to stable we will be releasing a stable version.

**PLEASE ENABLE HOLIDAY CREATOR FEATURES AND BETA API**

# üß© What can I make with the library right now?
Jigsaw Block Bedrock offers many of the same features as Java Edition's Jigsaw block and we believe that JBB is close to being just as powerful. 

Currently, the library is packed with, 

- Accurate (90%) port of Java edition's Jigsaw system, including Template Pools
- Automatic structure rotation and offset adjustment
- Automatic structure collision detection
- Built with map makers in mind, easy to use macro/"pick block" system
- Compatible with any Add-On
- Preview support
- Jigsaw UI 
- Multiple test structures & examples
- Node JS automatic install script/optional exe

**We would love as much support as we can get! The more people who step foward to make 100% open source, easy to use/download libraries, the further we can get in advancing our creation capabilities.**
